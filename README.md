# WesBos30DayJSChallenge
A 30 day vanilla Javascript challenge by Wes Bos. I will be uploading files with descriptions of what I have learned from each challenge.

Challenge 1, Make a Javascript Drum Kit Using Vanilla JS

What I learned:
kbd tags are used to represent keyboard input.
data- can be used before a name to create a data attribute.
In 'removeTransition' function, created conditional if statement to remove 'playing' class if there is no 'transform' property name.
'playSound' function plays sound based on key pressed and adds the 'playing' class to transform css properties.
transitionEnd triggers the 'removeTransition' function.
keyDown event triggers 'playSound' function.
